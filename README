From the PI to the CUBE
=======================

Read from the Dallas One wire bus on a raspberry pi and post to cube(http://square.github.io/cube/). Right now it only supports temprature readings from (quite awesome) w1-gpio kernel module.

Really, there isn't much here. Please let me know if this is in any way interesting, I've probably made more progress since pushing.
